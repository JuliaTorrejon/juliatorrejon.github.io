An array is the most fundamental data structure, which stores elements at contiguous memory location. 

The key to solving array-based questions is having a good knowledge of array data structure (arrays, linked lists, hash table(dictionary), stack, queue and set), as well as basic programming constructors such as loop, recursion, and fundamental operators.

Here are some of the popular array-based coding interview questions to practice with Python:

#### 1. How do you find the missing number in a given integer array of 1 to 100?

Given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to 100

| Things to consider   |
| ------------- |
| The array doesn't contain more than one missing number      | 
| The array doesn't contain duplicates      | 
| Consider we have stored our numbers in arr[ ]   | 


| Method: Sum formula (Sum of numbers from 1 to n)  |
| ------------- |
| 1. Get the sum of numbers which is total = n*(n+1)/2   | 
| 2. Subtract all the numbers from sum and you will get the missing number (sum=sum-arr[i])  | 
  
 Time Complexity : O(n)
 
 Space Complexity : O(1)

  If there is an array from of size n ans elements are from 1 to n without repetetions,
  the sum of the elements of the array should be : (n * (n+1) )/2

  Now if one number ,say x is removed ,
  then the sum of the elements in the new array will be : (n*(n+1))/2 - x

  so the absent element = Original sum - new sum

  So find the new sum , by summing all the elements in the array and subract it from

  (n*(n+1))/2 to get the value of the absent number.    


#### Code: Python
```python
def find_missing_number(list_num):
	n = len(list_num)
	orig_sum = (n*(n+1))>>1
	new_sum = sum(list_num)
	missing_number = (orig_sum-new_sum)
	return missing_number
  ```
